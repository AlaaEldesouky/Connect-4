                Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game that can be played on a computer or 
                with a board and disks. The board is made up of horizontal and vertical columns 
                that contain slots, and each player takes turns dropping their disks into the slots.
                 The object of the game is to match four of your disks in a connected line, either horizontally,
                 vertically, or diagonally. While this may seem like a simple task, there is a lot of strategy 
                involved, 
                and learning the different techniques and tactics can help you win the game more often.
